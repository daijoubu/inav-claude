# Todo List: Redesign Configurator Navigation Menu

## Phase 1: Research & Analysis

- [ ] Review all 24 current navigation tabs
  - [ ] Document purpose of each tab
  - [ ] Identify which are setup vs tuning vs advanced
  - [ ] Note which tabs are commonly used together
- [ ] Analyze user workflows
  - [ ] Initial setup workflow (new users)
  - [ ] Pre-flight check workflow
  - [ ] Tuning workflow (advanced users)
  - [ ] Feature discovery (occasional users)
- [ ] Research navigation patterns
  - [ ] Study similar applications (Betaflight, Ardupilot configurators)
  - [ ] Review common UI patterns for long navigation lists
  - [ ] Consider responsive/mobile patterns
- [ ] Create logical groupings
  - [ ] Group related tabs by function
  - [ ] Identify 5-7 high-level categories
  - [ ] Document rationale for groupings

## Phase 2: Mockup Option 1

- [ ] Select first UI approach (e.g., collapsible accordion)
- [ ] Create visual mockup
  - [ ] Design collapsed state
  - [ ] Design expanded state
  - [ ] Show how tabs are accessed
  - [ ] Maintain current dark theme aesthetic
- [ ] Create interactive prototype (HTML/CSS) or design file
- [ ] Document approach
  - [ ] Describe the pattern used
  - [ ] List pros of this approach
  - [ ] List cons of this approach
  - [ ] Note implementation complexity

## Phase 3: Mockup Option 2

- [ ] Select second UI approach (different from Option 1)
- [ ] Create visual mockup
  - [ ] Show navigation structure
  - [ ] Demonstrate how categories work
  - [ ] Show selected state
  - [ ] Show how users navigate between tabs
- [ ] Create interactive prototype (HTML/CSS) or design file
- [ ] Document approach
  - [ ] Describe the pattern used
  - [ ] List pros of this approach
  - [ ] List cons of this approach
  - [ ] Note implementation complexity

## Phase 4: Mockup Option 3

- [ ] Select third UI approach (different from Options 1 & 2)
- [ ] Create visual mockup
  - [ ] Show navigation layout
  - [ ] Demonstrate interaction model
  - [ ] Maintain accessibility to all tabs
  - [ ] Consider responsive behavior
- [ ] Create interactive prototype (HTML/CSS) or design file
- [ ] Document approach
  - [ ] Describe the pattern used
  - [ ] List pros of this approach
  - [ ] List cons of this approach
  - [ ] Note implementation complexity

## Phase 5: Analysis & Comparison

- [ ] Create comparison table
  - [ ] Compare all three options
  - [ ] Rate on: usability, simplicity, discoverability, efficiency
  - [ ] Note implementation effort for each
- [ ] Analyze for different user types
  - [ ] Beginner user perspective
  - [ ] Advanced user perspective
  - [ ] Occasional user perspective
- [ ] Consider technical constraints
  - [ ] Electron framework compatibility
  - [ ] Responsive/window resize behavior
  - [ ] Dark theme consistency

## Phase 6: Recommendation

- [ ] Select preferred option
- [ ] Document rationale for recommendation
  - [ ] Why this option is best
  - [ ] How it addresses the "long list" problem
  - [ ] How it improves user workflows
  - [ ] Trade-offs accepted
- [ ] Provide implementation roadmap
  - [ ] Estimated implementation effort
  - [ ] Key technical challenges
  - [ ] Suggested phased approach if needed
- [ ] Suggest next steps
  - [ ] User feedback collection approach
  - [ ] A/B testing recommendations
  - [ ] Iteration plan

## Phase 7: Documentation

- [ ] Create design proposal document
  - [ ] Executive summary
  - [ ] Current state analysis
  - [ ] Tab categorization
  - [ ] Three mockup options with visuals
  - [ ] Pros/cons comparison
  - [ ] Recommendation
  - [ ] Implementation considerations
- [ ] Organize deliverables
  - [ ] Mockup files in workspace
  - [ ] Screenshots/exports for documentation
  - [ ] Design proposal markdown file

## Completion

- [ ] All three mockups created
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Comparison analysis done
- [ ] Recommendation provided
- [ ] Files organized in workspace
- [ ] Send completion report to manager
