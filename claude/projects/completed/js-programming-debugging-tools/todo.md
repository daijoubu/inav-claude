# Todo: Javascript Programming Tab Debugging Tools

**Project:** Design Phase Only (Exploration and Proposals)
**Status:** 📋 TODO

---

## Phase 1: Research & Analysis

- [ ] **Examine existing Programming tab value display**
  - [ ] Understand how current values are shown
  - [ ] Find MSP commands used for value queries
  - [ ] Determine query frequency and performance impact
  - [ ] Document current implementation

- [ ] **Investigate decompiler system**
  - [ ] Understand how decompiled code is generated
  - [ ] Map relationship between decompiled expressions and Logic Conditions
  - [ ] Identify which expressions can be evaluated
  - [ ] Document expression → LC mapping mechanism

- [ ] **Research UI/UX patterns**
  - [ ] Review debugging tools in other IDEs (VSCode, Chrome DevTools, etc.)
  - [ ] Identify successful debugging UI patterns
  - [ ] Consider Configurator UI constraints and style
  - [ ] Note accessibility considerations

---

## Phase 2: Proposal Development

- [ ] **Proposal 1: Mouseover Value Display**
  - [ ] Description and user workflow
  - [ ] Technical approach (tooltip implementation)
  - [ ] Pros and cons analysis
  - [ ] Effort estimate
  - [ ] UI mockup/description

- [ ] **Proposal 2: [Approach TBD]**
  - [ ] Description and user workflow
  - [ ] Technical approach
  - [ ] Pros and cons analysis
  - [ ] Effort estimate
  - [ ] UI mockup/description

- [ ] **Proposal 3: [Approach TBD]**
  - [ ] Description and user workflow
  - [ ] Technical approach
  - [ ] Pros and cons analysis
  - [ ] Effort estimate
  - [ ] UI mockup/description

- [ ] **Proposal 4: [Approach TBD]**
  - [ ] Description and user workflow
  - [ ] Technical approach
  - [ ] Pros and cons analysis
  - [ ] Effort estimate
  - [ ] UI mockup/description

---

## Phase 3: Analysis & Recommendation

- [ ] **Comparison Matrix**
  - [ ] Create side-by-side comparison table
  - [ ] Compare: user value, complexity, effort, performance impact
  - [ ] Identify dependencies between approaches
  - [ ] Note which can be combined

- [ ] **Feasibility Assessment**
  - [ ] Technical feasibility for each proposal
  - [ ] Performance impact analysis
  - [ ] UI/UX impact analysis
  - [ ] Browser compatibility considerations

- [ ] **Recommendation**
  - [ ] Recommend which approach(es) to implement
  - [ ] Justify recommendation (user value vs. effort)
  - [ ] Suggest implementation order (if multiple)
  - [ ] Identify potential risks

---

## Phase 4: Documentation

- [ ] **Create Design Document**
  - [ ] Executive summary
  - [ ] Four proposals (detailed)
  - [ ] Comparison matrix
  - [ ] Recommendation section
  - [ ] Next steps for implementation

- [ ] **File Location**
  - [ ] Save to: `claude/developer/workspace/js-programming-debugging-tools/PROPOSALS.md`
  - [ ] Include diagrams/mockups if helpful

---

## Completion

- [ ] All research complete
- [ ] Four proposals documented with all required sections
- [ ] Comparison and recommendation provided
- [ ] Design document reviewed for clarity
- [ ] Send completion report to manager

---

## Next Steps (Post-Approval)

- [ ] Manager reviews proposals
- [ ] Manager approves one or more approaches
- [ ] Create implementation project for chosen approach(es)
- [ ] Estimate implementation effort
- [ ] Begin development

---

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours (design phase only)
