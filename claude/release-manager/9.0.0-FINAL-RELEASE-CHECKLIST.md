# INAV 9.0.0 Final Release Checklist

**Release Type:** Final Release (9.0.0)
**Created:** 2026-01-15
**Release Manager:** Claude

---

## CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: Final Release Requirements

This is the **FINAL 9.0.0 release**, not a release candidate. Key differences from RC releases:
- **NO `--prerelease` flag** when creating releases
- Firmware files named `inav_9.0.0_TARGET.hex` (NO "RC" suffix)
- Tag names are `9.0.0` (NO "RC" suffix)
- Release notes are cumulative from all RCs
- More thorough verification required

**Target Commits:**
- **Firmware:** `a7932b92e` (upstream/maintenance-9.x) - 35 commits ahead of RC4
- **Configurator:** `882c183` (downloaded builds from Jan 14, 2026)

---

## PHASE 0: Pre-Release Validation

### 0.1 Verify Target Commits
- [ ] Confirm firmware at commit `a7932b92eadd92ba7851a009a5c974b9cc24835d`
- [ ] Confirm configurator builds from commit `882c183` (need to verify this is on upstream/maintenance-9.x)
- [ ] Document commit SHAs for both repositories

### 0.2 Verify Build Status
- [ ] Firmware built successfully from `inav/build/` directory
- [ ] Configurator builds downloaded and organized in `claude/release-manager/downloads/configurator-9.0.0/`
- [ ] Count firmware hex files (should be ~219 targets)
- [ ] Count configurator files (should be 14: 6 Linux, 4 macOS, 4 Windows)

### 0.3 Check for Additional Changes
- [ ] Verify no critical PRs merged after firmware build that should be included
- [ ] Verify no critical PRs merged after configurator build that should be included
- [ ] If critical changes exist: STOP and rebuild

---

## PHASE 1: Firmware Artifact Preparation

### 1.1 Copy Firmware Hex Files
```bash
# Create firmware download directory
mkdir -p claude/release-manager/downloads/firmware-9.0.0

# Copy all hex files from build directory
cp inav/build/*.hex claude/release-manager/downloads/firmware-9.0.0/
```

- [ ] Copy hex files from `inav/build/*.hex` to `downloads/firmware-9.0.0/`
- [ ] Verify all files copied successfully
- [ ] Count files: `ls downloads/firmware-9.0.0/*.hex | wc -l` (expect ~219)

### 1.2 Rename Firmware Files for Final Release
Firmware files from build will have format like `inav_9.0.0_TARGET.hex` or may include build suffixes. Need to ensure they're properly named for final release.

```bash
# Check current naming format
ls downloads/firmware-9.0.0/ | head -5

# If files have CI suffixes (_ci-YYYYMMDD-hash), use the rename script:
cd claude/release-manager
./rename-firmware-for-release.sh 9.0.0 downloads/firmware-9.0.0/
```

- [ ] Check current filename format
- [ ] Rename if needed to format: `inav_9.0.0_TARGET.hex` (NO "RC" suffix)
- [ ] Verify naming: spot-check 5 files have correct format
- [ ] Document: firmware files ready at `downloads/firmware-9.0.0/`

---

## PHASE 2: Configurator Artifact Preparation

### 2.1 Verify Configurator Files
Files are already downloaded to `downloads/configurator-9.0.0/` with subdirectories per platform/format.

**Expected structure:**
```
downloads/configurator-9.0.0/
├── inav-configurator_linux_aarch64_9.0.0_ci-20260114-882c183_DEB/
├── inav-configurator_linux_aarch64_9.0.0_ci-20260114-882c183_RPM/

└── inav-configurator_Windows64_9.0.0_ci-20260114-882c183_ZIP/
```

- [ ] Verify all 14 configurator artifact directories exist
- [ ] Verify each directory contains the actual installable file (e.g., `.deb`, `.dmg`, `.zip`, `.msi`)

### 2.2 Extract Configurator Files for Upload
The actual files are inside the subdirectories. Need to collect them for upload.

```bash
# Create organized upload directories
mkdir -p downloads/configurator-9.0.0-upload/{linux,macos,windows}

# Copy Linux files
cp downloads/configurator-9.0.0/inav-configurator_linux_*_DEB/*.deb downloads/configurator-9.0.0-upload/linux/
cp downloads/configurator-9.0.0/inav-configurator_linux_*_RPM/*.rpm downloads/configurator-9.0.0-upload/linux/
cp downloads/configurator-9.0.0/inav-configurator_linux_*_ZIP/*.zip downloads/configurator-9.0.0-upload/linux/

# Copy macOS files
cp downloads/configurator-9.0.0/inav-configurator_MacOS_*_DMG/*.dmg downloads/configurator-9.0.0-upload/macos/
cp downloads/configurator-9.0.0/inav-configurator_MacOS_*_ZIP/*.zip downloads/configurator-9.0.0-upload/macos/

# Copy Windows files
cp downloads/configurator-9.0.0/inav-configurator_Windows*_MSI/*.msi downloads/configurator-9.0.0-upload/windows/
cp downloads/configurator-9.0.0/inav-configurator_Windows*_ZIP/*.zip downloads/configurator-9.0.0-upload/windows/
```

- [ ] Create upload directories organized by platform
- [ ] Copy all Linux files (6 files: 2 DEB, 2 RPM, 2 ZIP - x64 and aarch64)
- [ ] Copy all macOS files (4 files: 2 DMG, 2 ZIP - arm64 and x64)
- [ ] Copy all Windows files (4 files: 2 MSI, 2 ZIP - x86 and x64)
- [ ] Verify file count: `find downloads/configurator-9.0.0-upload -type f | wc -l` (expect 14)

---

## PHASE 3: Critical Verification (MUST NOT SKIP)

### 3.1 macOS DMG Verification
**CRITICAL:** Verify macOS DMGs do NOT contain Windows binaries (fix was done in PR #2508).

```bash
cd claude/release-manager
./verify-dmg-contents.sh downloads/configurator-9.0.0-upload/macos/*.dmg
```

- [ ] Run verification script on all macOS DMG files
- [ ] Confirm: NO Windows files (.exe, .dll, .msi) found in DMGs
- [ ] Confirm: NO Linux binaries found in DMGs
- [ ] Confirm: ONLY `sitl/macos/` or `sitl/darwin/` directory exists
- [ ] Confirm: Valid Mach-O executable format
- [ ] Confirm: Correct architecture (arm64 vs x64 matches filename)
- [ ] **If ANY verification fails: STOP and escalate to developer**

### 3.2 Windows SITL cygwin1.dll Verification
**CRITICAL:** Windows SITL requires cygwin1.dll to run. Without it, users get errors.

```bash
cd claude/release-manager
./verify-windows-sitl.sh downloads/configurator-9.0.0-upload/windows/INAV-Configurator_win_x64_9.0.0.zip
```

- [ ] Run verification script on Windows x64 zip file
- [ ] Confirm: `cygwin1.dll` EXISTS in `resources/sitl/windows/`
- [ ] Confirm: `inav_SITL.exe` exists in same directory
- [ ] Verify cygwin1.dll size is reasonable (~2.9 MB)
- [ ] **If cygwin1.dll missing: STOP and escalate to developer**

### 3.3 Linux SITL glibc Verification
**CRITICAL:** Linux SITL must support Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (glibc <= 2.35).

```bash
# Extract a Linux configurator zip
cd downloads/configurator-9.0.0-upload/linux
unzip INAV-Configurator_linux_x64_9.0.0.zip -d /tmp/test-configurator

# Check glibc requirement (should be 2.35 or lower)
objdump -T /tmp/test-configurator/resources/sitl/linux/inav_SITL | \
  grep GLIBC | sed 's/.*GLIBC_//;s/ .*//' | sort -V | tail -1

# Clean up
rm -rf /tmp/test-configurator
```

- [ ] Extract Linux x64 configurator
- [ ] Check SITL binary glibc requirement
- [ ] Verify glibc version is **<= 2.35**
- [ ] If glibc > 2.35: STOP - binary won't work on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- [ ] Document glibc version found

### 3.4 Firmware Hex File Spot Check
- [ ] Count firmware hex files: `ls downloads/firmware-9.0.0/*.hex | wc -l`
- [ ] Expected count: ~219 targets
- [ ] Spot-check 5 random files:
  - [ ] File size > 100 KB (typical for firmware)
  - [ ] Filename format: `inav_9.0.0_TARGET.hex` (NO "RC")
  - [ ] Files are valid Intel HEX format (start with `:`)

---

## PHASE 4: Documentation Preparation

### 4.1 Generate Changelog (RC4 to Final)

Need to document all changes from RC4 to the final release (35 commits in firmware).

git log --oneline 9.0.0-RC4..a7932b92e > /tmp/firmware-changes.txt

# Configurator changes since RC4 (need to determine configurator RC4 tag commit)
cd ../inav-configurator
git log --oneline 9.0.0-RC4..882c183 > /tmp/configurator-changes.txt
```

- [ ] Generate firmware changelog (RC4 to a7932b92e)
