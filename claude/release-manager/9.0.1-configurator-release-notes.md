# Upgrading to INAV 9.0.1

## Upgrading from INAV 9.0.0

Simply download and install the new INAV Configurator 9.0.1. No other changes needed.

## Upgrading from INAV 8.0

1. Download and install the new [INAV Configurator 9.0.1](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
2. Backup configuration with CLI `diff all` command or use the _Diff All_ and _Save to file_ buttons.
3. Flash INAV 9.0.1 **WITH** _Full Chip Erase_ option enabled
4. Load your 8.0 `Diff` settings in to the CLI. Then take a note or write down the incompatible settings changes marked in RED.
5. Then copy your 8.0 `Diff` file and rename it 9.0. And edit the old incompatible settings.
6. Go to CLI and load your edited INAV 9.0 `Diff`
7. Done

>[!Tip]
> **Concerning step 6**.
> It can be a safer option to load your `Diff All` settings in two parts if you are using multiple Profiles. e.g. _Control, Mixer or Battery_.
>This can be done by copying and loading the `Diff All` text setting from the top, down to the bottom of the `# master` settings category. Then load that into the CLI and press enter. Once it has written, press the _Save Settings_ button.
>Wait until it reboots and go back to the CLI tab again, then copy and load the rest of the `Diff All` text file. Starting from the `# Control_profile 1` settings category, down to the bottom. Press enter. Once written, it will save by itself.

## Diff update tool
Rather than steps 4 and 5 above. You can try this diff update tool. This is a work in progress. Currently it will try to update version 7 or later diffs to version 8 or later. Just paste your full `diff all` (not `dump`) in to the tool. Select the INAV version you're upgrading to. Then press the button. It will create a new `diff` for you and give you warnings about anything you should check.
