## 🔍 LESSONS LEARNED

### Technical Issues Encountered

1. **Sandbox Limitations with Large Files**
   - **Issue:** Configurator packages (100-157 MB) failed to upload in sandbox mode
   - **Errors:** `tls: bad record MAC`, `tls: protocol version not supported`
   - **Solution:** Used `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` for large file uploads
   - **Documented in:** Release manager guides

2. **gh CLI Version Limitations**
   - **Issue:** Current `gh` version doesn't support `--notes-file` for editing releases
   - **Workaround:** Manual update via GitHub web interface
   - **Future:** Consider upgrading gh CLI or using GitHub API directly

3. **Release Notes Format Clarification**
   - **Issue:** Initial misunderstanding about combining vs removing RC sections
   - **Resolution:** Created comprehensive "Major Changes Since 8.0.1" sections that COMBINE all RC content
   - **Documented in:** `guides/5-changelog-and-notes.md` - "Final Release Notes Pattern"

### Process Improvements

1. **Release Notes Pattern Documented**
   - Final releases should COMBINE RC content into comprehensive categories
   - Not list individual RC sections (RC4, RC3, RC2, RC1)
   - Provides better user experience for those upgrading from last stable

2. **Verification Scripts Enhanced**
   - macOS DMG verification script works well on Linux
   - Windows SITL verification ensures cygwin1.dll present
   - Linux SITL glibc check prevents compatibility issues

3. **Documentation Organization**
   - Phase-specific guides work well for complex releases
   - Status documents help track progress across sessions
   - Archived checklists preserve release history

## 🎯 WHAT'S NEXT

### Immediate (Optional)
- Monitor GitHub issues for critical bugs (first 24-48 hours)
- Monitor Discord for user reports
- Coordinate announcements if not already done

### Near-Term
- Consider hotfix 9.0.1 if critical issues discovered
- Plan 9.1.0 or 10.0.0 development cycle

### Maintenance Branches
All maintenance branches created and ready for use:
- `maintenance-9.x` - For 9.x patches and fixes
- `maintenance-10.x` - For breaking changes targeting 10.0

**PR Branch Strategy:**
- Current stable work → maintenance-9.x
- Breaking changes → maintenance-10.x
- master → mirrors maintenance-9.x (safety net)
