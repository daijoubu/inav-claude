# INAV 9.0.0 Announcement - Usage Notes

## Files Created

1. **`9.0.0-announcement-discord.md`** - Discord announcement (supports markdown)
2. **`9.0.0-announcement-facebook.txt`** - Facebook announcement (plain text with emojis)

---

## Discord Posting

- Copy content from `9.0.0-announcement-discord.md`
- Discord supports markdown formatting (bold, links, etc.)
- **⚠️ Discord has a 2000-character limit** - keep announcements concise
- Post in `#announcements` channel
- Consider pinning the announcement

### Discord Character Limit Considerations
- Main message: 2000 characters max
- If announcement is too long, consider:
  - Removing detailed feature descriptions
  - Keeping only top 3-5 features instead of listing many
  - Moving some content to a follow-up message or thread
  - Using more concise language

---

## Facebook Posting

- Copy content from `9.0.0-announcement-facebook.txt`
- Facebook does NOT support markdown, so the text uses emojis and line breaks for structure
- Hashtags included at the end for better reach

### Suggested Image

For Facebook, attach an image showing:
- **Option 1:** Screenshot of the INAV Configurator 9.0.0 with the new features visible (OSD preview, map view, or programming tab)
- **Option 2:** INAV logo/banner with "9.0.0" version
- **Option 3:** Composite image showing:
  - Top: INAV logo/title with "Version 9.0.0"
  - Bottom: Screenshots of key features (JavaScript programming tab, new OSD elements, Esri maps)

The image from the release notes wiki shows the INAV 7 Falcon graphic at:
`https://quadmeup.com/assets/inav_7_falcon.png`

You could use a similar styled graphic for 9.0.0 if available, or create a simple banner with:
- INAV logo
- "Version 9.0.0"
- "Now Available"
- Maybe icons representing JavaScript, maps, OSD elements

**Image size recommendation for Facebook:**
- 1200 x 630 pixels (optimal for link sharing)
- PNG format for best quality
