## PHASE 11 TASKS

### Task 1: Create Maintenance Branches

Since this is a major version release (9.0.0), maintenance branches should be created:

**Strategy:**
- `maintenance-9.x` - Current stable branch (for 9.x patches and fixes)
- `maintenance-10.x` - Next major version (for breaking changes)
- `master` - Will track maintenance-9.x (safety net for contributors)

**Commands:**

```bash
# Get full commit SHAs
FIRMWARE_SHA="a7932b92eadd92ba7851a009a5c974b9cc24835d"
CONFIGURATOR_SHA="882c18386e7e5eddce15e7d03e9a6868caae8a8b"

# Create firmware branches
gh api repos/iNavFlight/inav/git/refs \
  -f ref="refs/heads/maintenance-9.x" \
  -f sha="$FIRMWARE_SHA"

gh api repos/iNavFlight/inav/git/refs \
  -f ref="refs/heads/maintenance-10.x" \
  -f sha="$FIRMWARE_SHA"

# Create configurator branches
gh api repos/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/git/refs \
  -f ref="refs/heads/maintenance-9.x" \
  -f sha="$CONFIGURATOR_SHA"

gh api repos/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/git/refs \
  -f ref="refs/heads/maintenance-10.x" \
  -f sha="$CONFIGURATOR_SHA"
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Create maintenance-9.x branch for firmware
- [ ] Create maintenance-10.x branch for firmware
- [ ] Create maintenance-9.x branch for configurator
- [ ] Create maintenance-10.x branch for configurator
- [ ] Verify branches created successfully

**Status:** PENDING

### Task 2: Update PR Branch Suggestion Workflow

Update the GitHub Action that suggests version branches to contributors:

**Files to update:**
- `inav/.github/workflows/pr-branch-suggestion.yml`
- `inav-configurator/.github/workflows/pr-branch-suggestion.yml`

**Changes needed:**
Update branch names in the workflow to reflect current version (maintenance-9.x) and next version (maintenance-10.x).

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Update firmware PR branch suggestion workflow
- [ ] Update configurator PR branch suggestion workflow
- [ ] Commit and push changes

**Status:** PENDING

---

### Task 3: Archive Release Checklist

Move the completed release checklist to an archive directory:

```bash
mkdir -p claude/release-manager/archived-checklists
mv claude/release-manager/9.0.0-FINAL-RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md \
   claude/release-manager/archived-checklists/9.0.0-FINAL-RELEASE-CHECKLIST-COMPLETED.md
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Create archived-checklists directory (if needed)
- [ ] Move 9.0.0-FINAL-RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md to archive
- [ ] Rename with "-COMPLETED" suffix

**Status:** PENDING

### Task 4: Update Release Documentation

Document lessons learned and update release manager guides:

**Files to review/update:**
- `claude/release-manager/README.md` - General updates
- `claude/release-manager/guides/*.md` - Process improvements

**Lessons learned from this release:**
1. **Sandbox limitations:** Large file uploads (100-157 MB) require `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`
2. **Release notes format:** Final releases should COMBINE RC content, not list separately
3. **gh CLI version:** Current version doesn't support `--notes-file` for editing releases (requires manual web update)
4. **Firmware upload reliability:** Consider smaller batches if rate limiting occurs

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Document sandbox limitations in guides
- [ ] Ensure "Final Release Notes Pattern" is clear
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- [ ] Update examples with 9.0.0 as reference

**Status:** PENDING

---

### Task 5: Announcements (Optional)

Coordinate with project maintainers for announcements:

**Announcement channels:**
- Discord (#announcements)
- Facebook (INAV Official)
- Forum posts (if applicable)
- Wiki release notes update

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Discord announcement (coordinated with maintainers)
- [ ] Update any pinned issues referencing 9.0.0
- [ ] Ensure wiki release notes are current

**Status:** OPTIONAL - User discretion

---

### Task 6: Monitor for Critical Issues (Ongoing)

Monitor GitHub issues and Discord for critical bugs in the first 24-48 hours:

**What to watch for:**
- Reports of firmware bricking devices
- Configurator crashes or failures to launch
- SITL not working on specific platforms
- Download/installation problems

**Action if critical issue found:**
1. Assess severity
2. Coordinate with developers for fix
3. May need hotfix release (9.0.1)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Monitor GitHub issues (first 24 hours)
- [ ] Monitor Discord reports (first 24 hours)
- [ ] Document any critical issues found

**Status:** ONGOING - User discretion
