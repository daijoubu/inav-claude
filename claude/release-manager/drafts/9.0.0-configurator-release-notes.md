# Important!!
>We currently don't have access to an Apple Developer Account to sign the Mac binaries, so you will need to run the following command on MacOS
to unlock the configurator App: <code>xattr -cr "/path/to/your/INAV Configurator.app"</code></p>

Please carefully read all of this document for the best possible experience and safety.
