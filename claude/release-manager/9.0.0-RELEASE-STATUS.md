## ⚠️ MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED

**Action needed:**
1. Visit https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/releases/tag/9.0.0
2. Click "Edit"
3. Replace notes with content from `claude/release-manager/drafts/9.0.0-firmware-release-notes.md`
4. Save

5. Visit https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases/tag/9.0.0
6. Click "Edit"
7. Replace notes with content from `claude/release-manager/drafts/9.0.0-configurator-release-notes.md`
8. Save

**Why manual?** This version of `gh` CLI doesn't support editing release notes.

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Sandbox Issues Encountered

**Problem:** Configurator uploads failed in sandbox mode with TLS errors:
- `remote error: tls: bad record MAC`
- `remote error: tls: protocol version not supported`

**Solution:** Used `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` for large file uploads (100-157 MB).

**Lessons learned:**
- Sandbox mode has network restrictions that affect large file uploads to GitHub
- Firmware hex files (smaller, ~1-2 MB each) uploaded fine in sandbox
- Configurator packages (large, 100-157 MB each) required sandbox bypass

### Commands Used

**Upload firmware (in sandbox):**
```bash
gh release upload 9.0.0 *.hex --repo iNavFlight/inav --clobber
```

**Upload configurator (sandbox disabled):**
```bash
gh release upload 9.0.0 linux/* --repo iNavFlight/inav-configurator --clobber
gh release upload 9.0.0 macos/* --repo iNavFlight/inav-configurator --clobber
gh release upload 9.0.0 windows/* --repo iNavFlight/inav-configurator --clobber
```
