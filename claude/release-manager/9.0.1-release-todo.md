- **cmake/sitl.cmake linker fix** is LOCAL only — adds `--no-warn-rwx-segments` capability check for binutils 2.38
- **Windows SITL** was fixed in the nightly (previously failing in CI)
- **git push** required `http.postBuffer 524288000` for binary SITL files
- **SITL demo mode issue** reported during testing was caused by local eeprom, not a path bug
