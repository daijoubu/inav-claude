"""Classify DMA_STREAM_COLLISION hazards by severity.

Firmware ownership model (confirmed in timer_impl_stdperiph.c +
pwm_mapping.c:pwmInitMotors): motors are initialized strictly in position
order (idx = 0..motorCount-1); the FIRST entry to reach a shared DMA
descriptor claims it (dmaInit -> owner = OWNER_TIMER); every later entry
resolving to the same (dma,stream) tuple hits `owner != OWNER_FREE` and
silently fails to configure. So within one collision group, the LOWEST
position always wins and stays alive; every OTHER (higher) position in the
group is a loser and goes dead.

Severity is therefore about the losers, not the group as a whole:
  CERTAIN - the second-lowest position in the group (the best-case loser)
            is < 4, i.e. an S1-S4 output actually goes dead.
  NOTICE  - all losers are at position >= 4; the S1-S4 member of the group
            (if any) is the winner and keeps working fine.

On USE_DSHOT_DMAR targets, simulate_pwm_roles.py additionally emits
BURST_STREAM_COLLISION instead of (or alongside) DMA_STREAM_COLLISION for
groups affected by burst mode's per-PHYSICAL-TIMER (not per-channel) DMA
claim -- see that script's module docstring for the full model. This
script treats both hazard types identically for severity purposes (same
"loser position < 4" rule, same winner-always-lower-position guarantee),
since simulate_pwm_roles.py's BURST_STREAM_COLLISION text embeds the same
"TIM_CH" substrings this script matches positions against.

KNOWN BLIND SPOT, FIXED 2026-08-21: a MOTOR-vs-LED_STRIP collision can
NEVER be surfaced by the CERTAIN/NOTICE machinery above, structurally --
LED-strip rows never get a `position` (simulate_pwm_roles.py's per-row
loop only assigns `pos` for the MOTOR and SERVO buckets; the LED branch
leaves it None), and this function's `involved` list filters out any
tim_ch whose looked-up position is None before the `len(involved) < 2`
check even runs. So a real motor-vs-LED collision always collapses to a
1-element `involved` list and is silently dropped -- not misclassified,
just invisible, from every prior run of this tool. Found by hand while
using this script's output as a work list for Phase 2 step 3 of
investigate-shared-tim-dma-request-lines (AIKONF7's TIM3_CH2 vs TIM2_CH1
collision, where TIM2_CH1 is TIM_USE_LED, never appeared in any NOTICE
list despite firing at every motorCount from 4 up). A full re-sweep this
same pass found FURYF4OSD has the same previously-invisible pattern too
(TIM3_CH4 vs TIM5_CH1/LED_STRIP) -- both now correctly reported below by
`led_collisions()`, a structurally separate detection pass (LED-vs-motor
severity is always deterministic -- motors init before ledStripInit() in
fc_init.c, so a MOTOR side always wins and the LED silently just doesn't
light; never flight-critical, so there's no CERTAIN/NOTICE split to make
here, just a single LED_COLLISION bucket). The known parser-gap targets
(conditional-compilation flattening, see simulate_pwm_roles.py's
docstring) can also surface a same-(tim,ch)-twice false LED hit here the
same way they do for the motor/motor checks -- cross-check any new hit
against that 8-target list (or grep the target's target.c for #if/#ifdef
inside timerHardware[]) before trusting it.

Usage: python3 classify_collisions.py <inav-checkout-root> <targets-file>
<targets-file> lists one target name per line, F4/F7/AT32 only. Build it
with simulate_pwm_roles.detect_family() in ("F4","F7","AT32") to exclude
H7 (out of scope -- separate hazard model, handled by check_dma_conflicts.py).
