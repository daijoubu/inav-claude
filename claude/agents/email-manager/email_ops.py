Email Operations - Atomic, verified email lifecycle operations

Prevents the email-manager agent's hand-chained cp/rm/mv steps from ever
reporting success on a write that didn't actually land, by performing each
operation and then re-reading and hashing the result before returning.

Written for fix-email-outbox-not-cleared-after-delivery. Two independent
bugs were traced to the same failure shape: an LLM agent (email-manager
runs on Haiku) hand-chaining filesystem operations across multiple
locations with no atomicity and no verification.
  - Bug 1 (2026-08-02): the old "Send Email" step never removed a delivered
    draft from the sender's outbox/, so every send that used outbox/ left a
    permanent orphan there, which the old undelivered-mail check then
    misreported as stuck mail.
  - Bug 2 (2026-08-23, more severe): 6 developer completion reports for
    review-pr11553-vtol-transition (one with a CRITICAL flight-safety
    finding) were recorded as sent (present in developer/email/sent/) but
    never reached the manager's inbox at all. The workflow had no step
    that verified the inbox copy actually landed before reporting
    "Status: DELIVERED", so a failed or skipped copy was indistinguishable
    from a real one.

outbox/ itself was removed 2026-08-23 (per Ray, mid-investigation): this
system delivers by copying a file into a directory that always exists
locally, so there is no real scenario where a message is "composed but
not yet deliverable" the way there is in real email (network down,
recipient's server unreachable) - outbox/ never modeled anything real.
Worse, an outbox-based check can only ever catch a message that was
staged in outbox/ and mishandled from there; Bug 2 never touched outbox/
at all, so that entire class of check structurally could not have caught
the more serious bug. `audit` replaces it with a check that actually
matches the real failure mode: for every message in a role's sent/, parse
who it was addressed to and confirm a byte-identical copy exists in that
recipient's inbox somewhere - independent of whether anything was ever
staged anywhere first.

See claude/projects/active/fix-email-outbox-not-cleared-after-delivery/
summary.md for the full investigation.

Commands:
    send <sender-role> <recipient-role> <filename>
        Requires the message already drafted at
        claude/<sender-role>/email/sent/<filename> (write it there first,
        e.g. with the Write tool). Copies it to the recipient's inbox/ and
        verifies the copy is byte-identical. Raises loudly and leaves no
        partial state on any failure. Idempotent: re-running against an
        already-delivered message is a no-op success, not an error.
        Refuses to overwrite an inbox file whose content differs from the
        sent copy (that is what `update` is for).

    update <sender-role> <recipient-role> <filename>
        Like `send`, but overwrites an existing inbox copy whose content
        differs from the sent copy — for amending an already-delivered
        message (e.g. a manager adding an UPDATE section to a task
        assignment after delivery). The sent copy is authoritative: this
        command is the only way a differing inbox copy gets replaced.
        Copies claude/<sender-role>/email/sent/<filename> over the
        recipient's inbox/<filename> and verifies the result is
        byte-identical, raising loudly and leaving no partial state on any
        failure. Idempotent: re-running against an already-current inbox
        copy is a no-op success, not an error.

    archive <role> <filename>
        Moves claude/<role>/email/inbox/<filename> to inbox-archive/,
        verified: copies, confirms the copy is byte-identical, only then
        removes the inbox original.

    audit [--fix]
        Runs the delivery audit now, regardless of when it last ran, and
        records the run time in the audit flag file (see audit-if-due).
        For every message in every role's sent/, parses its "**To:**"
        header and confirms a byte-identical copy exists in that
        recipient's inbox/ or inbox-archive/. Reports any sent message
        with no matching delivery anywhere. With --fix, attempts to
        redeliver each one via the same verified `send` path (safe:
        send() is idempotent) and reports what got fixed vs. what still
        needs manual attention (e.g. an unparseable/unknown recipient).

    audit-if-due [--fix]
        Runs `audit` only if the audit flag file
        (claude/agents/email-manager/data/last-audit-timestamp.txt) is
        missing or older than AUDIT_INTERVAL_DAYS (7). Otherwise prints
        when the audit last ran and does nothing. Cheap to call on every
        email-manager invocation - it's a no-op the other 6 days a week.
