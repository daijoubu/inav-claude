zero camber, it is seen to consist of a straight line passing through the origin, curving
over at the higher values of CL,reaching a maximum value of C,, at an incidence of
as,known as the stalling point. After the stalling point, the lift coefficient decreases,
tending to level off at some lower value for higher incidences. The slope of
the straight portion of the curve is called the two-dimensional lift-curve slope,
(dCL/da), or a,. Its theoretical value for a thin section (strictly a curved or flat
plate) is 27r per radian (see Section 4.4.1). For a section of finite thickness in air, a
more accurate empirical value is

                                    dCL = 1.87r (1 +0.8-
                                   (zJm                          :>                         (1.66)

The value of C  ,,  is a very important characteristic of the aerofoil since it determines
the minimum speed at which an aeroplane can fly. A typical value for the type of
aerofoil section mentioned is about 1.5. The corresponding value of aswould be
around 18".
   Curves (b) and (c) in Fig. 1.23 are for sections that have the same thickness
distribution but that are cambered, (c) being more cambered than (b). The effect of
camber is merely to reduce the incidence at which a given lift coefficient is produced,
i.e. to shift the whole lift curve somewhat to the left, with negligible change in the
value of the lift-curve slope, or in the shape of the curve. This shift of the curve is
measured by the incidence at which the lift coefficient is zero. This is the no-lift
incidence, denoted by 00,and a typical value is -3". The same reduction occurs in a,.
Thus a cambered section has the same value of C L as does its thickness distribu-
tion, but this occurs at a smaller incidence.
   Modern, thin, sharp-nosed sections display a slightly different characteristic to the
above, as shown in Fig. 1.24. In this case, the lift curve has two approximately
straight portions, of different slopes. The slope of the lower portion is almost the
same as that for a thicker section but, at a moderate incidence, the slope takes a
different, smaller value, leading to a smaller value of CL, typically of the order of
unity. This change in the lift-curve slope is due to a change in the type of flow near
the nose of the aerofoil.

        The induced angle of incidence E is given by

        Considering a number of wings of the same symmetrical section but of different
        aspect ratios the above expression leads to a family of CL, a curves, as in Fig. 1.25,
        since the actual lift coefficient at a given section of the wing is equal to the lift
        coefficient for a two-dimensional wing at an incidence of am.
           For highly swept wings of very low aspect ratio (less than 3 or so), the lift curve
        slope becomes very small, leading to values of C,, of about 1.0, occurring at stalling
        incidences of around 45". This is reflected in the extreme nose-up landing attitudes of
        many aircraft designed with wings of this description.

Effect of Reynolds number on the C,: a curve
Reduction of Reynolds number moves the transition point of the boundary layer
rearwards on the upper surface of the wing. At low values of Re this may permit
a laminar boundary layer to extend into the adverse pressure gradient region of the
aerofoil. As a laminar boundary layer is much less able than a turbulent boundary
layer to overcome an adverse pressure gradient, the flow will separate from the
surface at a lower angle of incidence. This causes a reduction of C,.          This is a
problem that exists in model testing when it is always difficult to match full-scale and
model Reynolds numbers. Transition can be fixed artificially on the model by rough-
ening the model surface with carborundum powder at the calculated full-scale point.

Drag coefficient: lift coefficient
For a two-dimensional wing at low Mach numbers the drag contains no induced or
wave drag, and the drag coefficient is CD,.There are two distinct forms of variation
of CD with CL, both illustrated in Fig. 1.26.
   Curve (a) represents a typical conventional aerofoil with CD,fairly constant over
the working range of lift coefficient, increasing rapidly towards the two extreme
values of CL. Curve (b) represents the type of variation found for low-drag aerofoil
sections. Over much of the CL range the drag coefficient is rather larger than for the
conventional type of aerofoil, but within a restricted range of lift coefficient
(CL, to C b ) the profile drag coefficient is considerably less. This range of CL is
known as the favourable range for the section, and the low drag coefficient is due to
the design of the aerofoil section, which permits a comparatively large extent of
laminar boundary layer. It is for this reason that aerofoils of this type are also known
as laminar-flow sections. The width and depth of this favourable range or, more
graphically, low-drag bucket, is determined by the shape of the thickness distribu-
tion. The central value of the lift coefficient is known as the optimum or ideal lift
coefficient, Cbptor C,. Its value is decided by the shape of the camber line, and the
degree of camber, and thus the position of the favourable range may be placed where
desired by suitable design of the camber line. The favourable range may be placed to
cover the most common range of lift coefficient for a particular aeroplane, e.g. C b
may be slightly larger than the lift coefficient used on the climb, and CL, may be

        slightly less than the cruising lift coefficient. In such a case the aeroplane will have the
        benefit of a low value of the drag coefficient for the wing throughout most of the
        flight, with obvious benefits in performance and economy. Unfortunately it is not
        possible to have large areas of laminar flow on swept wings at high Reynolds numbers.
        To maintain natural laminar flow, sweep-back angles are limited to about 15".
           The effect of a finite aspect ratio is to give rise to induced drag and this drag
        coefficient is proportional to C i , and must be added to the curves of Fig. 1.26.

        Drag coefficient: (lift coefficient)*
        Since



        it follows that a curve of C , against C i will be a straight line of slope (1 s)/7rA. If    +
        the curve CO,against C i from Fig. 1.26 is added to the induced drag coefficient, that
        is to the straight line, the result is the total drag coefficient variation with      as           G,

Pitching moment coefficient

                                      dCL
the value of the constant depending on the point of the aerofoil section about which
CM is measured. Thus a curve of CM against CLis theoretically as shown in Fig. 1.29.
   Line (a) for which dCM/dCL fi - is for CM measured about the leading edge.
Line (c), for which the slope is zero, is for the case where CM is measured about the
aerodynamic centre. Line (b) would be obtained if CM were measured about a point
between the leading edge and the aerodynamic centre, while for (d) the reference
point is behind the aerodynamic centre. These curves are straight only for moderate
values of CL. As the lift coefficient approaches C,, ,the CM against CL curve departs
from the straight line. The two possibilities are sketched in Fig. 1.30.
   For curve (a) the pitching moment coefficient becomes more negative near the
stall, thus tending to decrease the incidence, and unstall the wing. This is known as
a stable break. Curve (b), on the other hand, shows that, near the stall, the pitching
moment coefficient becomes less negative. The tendency then is for the incidence to

        increase, aggravating the stall. Such a characteristic is an unstable break. This type of
        characteristic is commonly found with highly swept wings, although measures can be
        taken to counteract this undesirable behaviour.
