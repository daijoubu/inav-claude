# Aerodynamics Knowledge Base

This directory contains accumulated aerodynamic knowledge organized by topic, with citations to Houghton & Carpenter "Aerodynamics for Engineering Students" (5th Edition) and applications to INAV flight controller development.

## Contents

### Flight Dynamics

1. **[pitch-airspeed-relationship.md](pitch-airspeed-relationship.md)**
   - Topic: How pitch angle affects airspeed at constant throttle
   - Key equation: V ∝ 1/√CL ∝ 1/√α
   - INAV application: Fixed-wing altitude/speed control coupling
   - References: H&C pages 26-49, 62-67

2. **[power-flight-path-angle.md](power-flight-path-angle.md)**
   - Topic: Power required to maintain constant airspeed during climbs/descents
   - Key equation: P = P_level × (1 + [L/D] × sin(γ))
   - INAV application: Throttle optimization, energy management, range estimation
   - References: H&C pages 26-44, 62-67
   - Includes: Small angle linearity analysis (sin(γ) ≈ γ for |γ| < 15°)

### Related Topics

These two documents are complementary:

**Constant Throttle Scenario (pitch-airspeed-relationship.md):**
- Pitch changes → angle of attack changes → lift coefficient changes → airspeed changes
- Aircraft exchanges altitude for airspeed (or vice versa)
- Phugoid oscillation behavior

**Constant Airspeed Scenario (power-flight-path-angle.md):**
- Flight path angle changes → power requirement changes
- Gravity assists in descent, opposes in climb
- Throttle adjustments needed to maintain airspeed

**Combined Understanding:**
In real flight, pilot/autopilot controls:
1. **Pitch** - Primary control of angle of attack and instantaneous lift
2. **Throttle** - Primary control of energy state (altitude + speed)

These are coupled - changing one affects both airspeed and altitude over time.

## Organization

Each knowledge base entry includes:

1. **Summary** - Quick reference of key concepts

3. **Derivation** - Where equations come from (when relevant)
4. **Textbook Citations** - Specific page references to Houghton & Carpenter
5. **INAV Applications** - How theory applies to flight controller code
6. **Practical Examples** - Worked problems with realistic numbers
7. **Limitations** - Assumptions and when they break down
8. **References** - Sources and related topics

## Contributing

When adding new knowledge base entries:

1. Use clear, descriptive filenames (lowercase, hyphens, .md extension)
2. Include H&C page citations where applicable
3. Provide INAV-specific applications
4. Cross-reference related topics
5. Update this README with new entries
