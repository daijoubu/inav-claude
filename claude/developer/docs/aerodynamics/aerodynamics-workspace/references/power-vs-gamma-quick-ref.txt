POWER vs FLIGHT PATH ANGLE - QUICK REFERENCE
============================================

For constant airspeed flight

KEY EQUATION
-----------
P = P_level × (1 + [L/D] × sin(γ))

Where:
  P_level = power required in level flight at airspeed V
  L/D     = lift-to-drag ratio (typical: 8-12 for model aircraft)
  γ       = flight path angle (+ climb, - descent, radians or degrees)

SIGN CONVENTION
--------------
  γ > 0  →  Climb    →  Power increases (gravity opposes)
  γ = 0  →  Level    →  Baseline power
  γ < 0  →  Descent  →  Power decreases (gravity assists)

TYPICAL VALUES
-------------
Aircraft Type          L/D    Best Glide Angle
-------------------------------------------------
Sailplane/Glider      30-60      1.0° - 2.0°
General Aviation      10-15      4.0° - 6.0°
Fixed-wing RC Model    8-12      5.0° - 7.0°
Flying Wing            6-10      6.0° - 9.5°
Multirotor (fwd)       3-5       11° - 19°

POWER TABLE (L/D = 10)
---------------------
Flight Path   sin(γ)   Power Factor   Power (if P_level=100W)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Climb 15°     +0.259   1 + 2.59       P = 359 W  (3.6× level)
Climb 10°     +0.174   1 + 1.74       P = 274 W  (2.7× level)
Climb  5°     +0.087   1 + 0.87       P = 187 W  (1.9× level)
Level  0°      0.000   1 + 0.00       P = 100 W  (baseline)
Descent -5°   -0.087   1 - 0.87       P =  13 W  (0.13× level)
Glide -5.74°  -0.100   1 - 1.00       P =   0 W  (no power!)
Descent -10°  -0.174   1 - 1.74       P = -74 W  (need brakes!)

SPECIAL CASES
------------
Best Glide (P = 0):
  γ_glide = arcsin(-1/[L/D])

  For L/D = 10:  γ = -5.74° = -0.1 rad
  Glide ratio: 10:1 (10m forward per 1m down)

Maximum Climb Angle (P = P_max):
  sin(γ_max) = (P_max - P_level) / (W × V)

SMALL ANGLE APPROXIMATION
------------------------
For |γ| < 15°:  sin(γ) ≈ γ (γ in radians)

Error:
  5°  → 0.11%  (negligible)
  10° → 0.52%  (excellent)
  15° → 1.16%  (good)

Code optimization:
  float gamma_rad = atan2f(climb_rate, ground_speed);
  float sin_gamma = (fabsf(gamma_rad) < 0.26f) ? gamma_rad : sinf(gamma_rad);

WORKED EXAMPLE
-------------
Aircraft: Fixed-wing model
  Cruise speed: 15 m/s
  Level flight power: 150 W
  L/D ratio: 10

Scenario: Descend at 5° while maintaining 15 m/s

Solution:
  γ = -5° = -0.0873 rad
  sin(-5°) = -0.0872

  P = 150 × (1 + 10 × (-0.0872))
    = 150 × (1 - 0.872)
    = 150 × 0.128
    = 19.2 W

Power reduction: 87% less than level flight!

PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION
----------------------
Descent at constant airspeed:
  - Potential energy decreases (losing altitude)
  - Kinetic energy constant (airspeed unchanged)
  - Gravity provides energy to overcome drag
  - Less propulsive power needed

Energy rate from gravity:
  P_gravity = W × V × sin(|γ|)

This exactly equals the power reduction in the equation.

INAV CODE SNIPPET
----------------
// Throttle optimization for constant airspeed descent
float gamma = atan2f(climb_rate, ground_speed);
float L_over_D = 10.0f;  // Estimated from aircraft type

float power_factor;
if (gamma < 0) {  // Descending
    power_factor = 1.0f - fabsf(gamma) * L_over_D;  // Small angle approx
    power_factor = constrainf(power_factor, 0.0f, 1.0f);
} else {  // Climbing
    power_factor = 1.0f + gamma * L_over_D;
}

throttle_pct = throttle_cruise * power_factor;

LIMITATIONS
----------
Assumes:
  - Constant airspeed (not accelerating)
  - Steady flight (no transient dynamics)
  - Small angles: L ≈ W (lift equals weight)
  - Constant L/D (drag polar unchanged)
  - No wind (flight path relative to air mass)

Real aircraft:
  - Propeller efficiency varies with speed
  - Fuselage incidence changes drag
  - Dynamic effects during maneuvers

SAFETY NOTES
-----------
1. Steeper than glide angle requires brakes/spoilers
2. Best glide maximizes range in emergency
3. High climb angles need significant excess power
4. Monitor airspeed - don't climb into stall!
