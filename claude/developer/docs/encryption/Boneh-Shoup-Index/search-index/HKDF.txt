Page  344: HKDF is a key derivation function specified in RFC 5869, and is deployed in many standards.
Page  344: HKDF is specified in terms of the HMAC construction (see Section 8.7). So it uses the function

Page  344: The execution of HKDF consists of two stages, called extract (which corresponds to what we
Page  344: In the extract stage, HKDF uses salt and s to compute
Page  345: When salt is empty, the extract stage of HKDF is the same as what we called HMAC0 in
Page  345: Users of HKDF have the option of providing non-zero salt. The salt plays a role akin to the
