Page  116: (due to B. Preneel). Here, visual data is encrypted in ECB mode, with each data block encoding
Page  116: We close this section with a proof that ECB mode is in fact secure if the message space is
Page  151: lustrated in Fig. 4.13. Notice that unlike ECB mode, the decryption algorithm D is never used.
Page  151: Clearly, deterministic counter mode has the advantage over ECB mode that it is semantically
Page  189: in Section 4.1.4 about ECB mode was technically about encrypting a single message consisting of
