Page   94: additional interface that is used to continuously add entropy to the RNG’s internal state, as shown
Page   94: in Fig. 3.14. The idea is that whenever the system has more random entropy to contribute to the
Page   94: RNG, this entropy is added into the RNG internal state. Whenever someone reads bits from the
Page   95: The UNIX RNG obtains its entropy from a number of hardware sources:
Page   95: • keyboard events: inter-keypress timings provide entropy;
Page   95: • hardware interrupts: time between hardware interrupts is a good source of entropy;
Page   95: RNG internal state. Notice that keyboard input is not used as a source of entropy; only keypress

Page   95: The RdRand generator should not replace other entropy sources such as the four sources described
Page   95: above; it should only augment them as an additional entropy source for the RNG. This way, if the
