## What Goes Where

### `docs/` - Documentation (Tracked)

General-purpose documentation that applies across projects:

| Subdirectory | Contents |
|--------------|----------|
| `testing/` | Testing guides, approaches, configurator testing |
| `debugging/` | Serial printf, GCC techniques, USB/MSC, performance, target splitting |
| `transpiler/` | Transpiler AST types, implementation notes |
| `patterns/` | Code patterns (e.g., MSP async data access) |
| `mspapi2/` | MSP API library documentation |

**Key debugging docs:**
- `debugging/usb-msc-debugging.md` - USB mass storage issues
- `debugging/performance-debugging.md` - PID loop performance
- `debugging/target-split-verification.md` - Target directory splitting
- `debugging/gcc-preprocessing-techniques.md` - GCC preprocessing

### `scripts/` - Reusable Scripts (Tracked)

Scripts that can be reused across multiple projects:

| Subdirectory | Contents |
|--------------|----------|
| `testing/` | CRSF test scripts, configurator startup tests, MSP test utilities |
| `build/` | Build and flash helpers |
| `analysis/` | Target verification, dead code detection, preprocessing tools |

### `workspace/` - Developer's Active Working Directories (Gitignored) **← USE THIS**

**Developer's scratch space for active tasks.**

Each active task gets its own subdirectory with all related working files:

**Structure:**
```
workspace/
└── my-task/
    ├── notes.md                # Working notes, findings
    ├── session-state.md        # Session tracking
    ├── test-results.md         # Test output
    ├── scripts/                # Task-specific scripts
    │   └── test_feature.py
    └── data/                   # Test data, logs
        └── sample.bin
```

**What goes here:**
- Session notes and scratch files
- Task-specific test scripts
- Test data and logs
- Status tracking documents
- Anything you're actively working on

**When to create a workspace directory:**
- Starting a new task assignment
- Beginning an investigation
- Any work that needs multiple files

**Cleanup:** When task is complete:
1. Move reusable scripts/docs to `scripts/` or `docs/`
2. Send comprehensive completion report to manager (they update `claude/projects/`)
3. Archive your workspace files to `archive/`

> **Note:** Don't confuse this with `claude/projects/` - that's the manager's project tracking directory with summary.md, todo.md, and INDEX.md for all projects. This `workspace/` is just your local scratch space while working.

### `investigations/` - Detailed Technical Investigations (Gitignored, Legacy)

**NOTE:** This directory is kept for backward compatibility with existing investigations. **For new work, use `workspace/` instead.**

Detailed investigation notes for specific technical issues. Contains legacy investigation directories with extensive notes and test data.

### `reports/` - Analysis Reports (Gitignored)

Code review reports, qodo analysis, PR reviews.

### `archive/` - Completed Work (Gitignored)

Historical data that might be useful for reference:
- `completed-tasks/` - Old task assignments
- `data/` - Test logs, profiling output, eeprom dumps
- `legacy/` - Old scripts, superseded documents

---

## Finding Things

### Need a test script?
Look in `scripts/testing/`

### Need to understand a past investigation?
1. Check `docs/LESSONS-LEARNED.md` for key insights
2. Look in `investigations/` for full details

### Need to verify a target split?
Use scripts in `scripts/analysis/`:
- `comprehensive_verification.py`
- `verify_target_conditionals.py`
- `split_omnibus_targets.py`

### Need debugging techniques?
Look in `docs/debugging/`

---

## Adding New Content

### Starting a new task?
**Create a workspace directory:**
```bash
mkdir -p claude/developer/workspace/my-task-name
cd claude/developer/workspace/my-task-name
```

**Structure it:**
```
workspace/my-task-name/
├── README.md           # What this task is about
├── notes.md            # Working notes
├── session-state.md    # Session tracking
├── scripts/            # Task-specific scripts
└── data/               # Test data, logs
```

### New reusable script?
Add to appropriate `scripts/` subdirectory with documentation.

### New documentation?
Add to appropriate `docs/` subdirectory.

### Test infrastructure?
Add to `scripts/testing/` with appropriate subdirectories (e.g., `scripts/testing/inav/`, `scripts/testing/configurator_indexer/`).

### Temporary scratch work?
Use `work-in-progress/` for quick notes (but prefer creating a `workspace/` directory for anything more than a single file).

## Gitignored Directories

The following are excluded from version control (`.gitignore`):

- `workspace/` - Developer's active working directories
- `investigations/` - Legacy investigation directories
- `work-in-progress/` - Legacy flat working directory
- `reports/` - Analysis reports
- `archive/` - Completed work
- `builds/` - Binary artifacts
- `email/` - Email directories (inbox, outbox, sent, inbox-archive)

**Why?** These contain session-specific and task-specific data. Reusable content (documentation, scripts) is extracted to tracked directories (`docs/`, `scripts/`), key findings are summarized to `claude/projects/`, then local files are archived.
