## 📊 Context Engineering Presentation

**Want to learn how this system works?** See [`claude/presentation/presentation-slides.md`](presentation/presentation-slides.md)

A 12-15 minute technical presentation explaining the context engineering techniques that make Claude Code consistently follow best practices:

- **5 Core Techniques:** Role separation, JIT documentation, specialized agents, reusable skills, enforcement hooks
- **Real Results:** 78 projects completed in 2 months with consistent workflow adherence
- **Context Efficiency:** ~1,500 lines loaded per task vs ~10-15k without system
- **Universal Workflow:** 12-step development process adaptable to any software project

**Files:**
- **Slides:** `claude/presentation/presentation-slides.md` (Marp format, dark theme)
- **Export:** See `claude/presentation/EXPORT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` for HTML/PDF/PPTX
- **Cheat Sheet:** `claude/presentation/PRESENTATION-CHEAT-SHEET.md`
- **All materials:** `claude/presentation/` directory

**Key Insight:** Context engineering turns Claude from a smart assistant into a reliable, professional development team member with consistent process adherence.

## Communication Flow

```
Manager creates task
    ↓
manager/email/sent/ → copy → developer/email/inbox/
                            ↓
                    Developer reads & implements
                            ↓
developer/email/sent/ → copy → manager/email/inbox/
    ↓
Manager reviews & archives
```

## Project Tracking

All projects are tracked in **`claude/projects/INDEX.md`**

- View active projects: `grep "^### 🚧" claude/projects/INDEX.md`
- View completed: `grep "^### ✅" claude/projects/INDEX.md`
- View backburner: `grep "^### ⏸️" claude/projects/INDEX.md`

## Key Principles

### Role Separation

**Manager:**
- ✅ Creates projects and tracks progress
- ✅ Assigns tasks via email
- ✅ Updates INDEX.md
- ✅ Archives completed work
- ❌ Never edits source code

**Developer:**
- ✅ Implements assigned tasks
- ✅ Writes and tests code
- ✅ Reports completion
- ✅ Asks questions when unclear
- ❌ Never directly updates INDEX.md or project tracking

**Release Manager:**
- ✅ Creates version tags in both repos
- ✅ Generates changelogs from merged PRs
- ✅ Builds firmware and configurator
- ✅ Creates and publishes GitHub releases
- ❌ Never modifies source code (only builds it)

### Communication Protocol

1. **Assignments flow:** manager → developer
2. **Reports flow:** developer → manager
3. **All communication** uses the email system (sent/inbox folders)
4. **Archive processed messages** to keep inboxes clean

### Project Lifecycle

```
TODO → IN PROGRESS → COMPLETED → Archived
             ↓
          BACKBURNER (paused)
             ↓
        CANCELLED (abandoned)
```

## Quick Reference

### Manager Commands

```bash
# Check for completion reports
ls -lt claude/manager/email/inbox/

# View active projects
grep "Status: IN PROGRESS" claude/projects/*/summary.md

# Archive completed project
mv claude/projects/<name> claude/archived_projects/

# Archive completion report
mv claude/manager/email/inbox/<report>.md claude/manager/email/inbox-archive/
```

### Developer Commands

```bash
# Check for new assignments
ls -lt claude/developer/email/inbox/

# Send completion report
cp claude/developer/email/sent/<report>.md claude/manager/email/inbox/

# Archive processed assignment
mv claude/developer/email/inbox/<task>.md claude/developer/email/inbox-archive/

# Build & test
cd inav && ./build.sh TARGETNAME
cd inav-configurator && npm test
```

## Initial Setup

After cloning this repository, you need to update the settings files with your actual home directory path.

**Required:** Replace `/home/user/` with your actual home directory in these files:
- `.claude/settings.json` - Hook script paths
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Permission rules (if it exists)

```bash
# Example for Linux/macOS:
sed -i "s|/home/user/|$HOME/|g" .claude/settings.json
sed -i "s|/home/user/|$HOME/|g" .claude/settings.local.json 2>/dev/null || true
```

The hook scripts need absolute paths to work correctly with Claude Code.

## Getting Started

1. **Determine your role** (Manager, Developer, or Release Manager)
2. **Read your role-specific README:**
   - Manager: [`claude/manager/README.md`](manager/README.md)
   - Developer: [`claude/developer/README.md`](developer/README.md)
   - Release Manager: [`claude/release-manager/README.md`](release-manager/README.md)
3. Tell your human which role you have detected and ask them if you should read your inbox now
4. **Start working** according to your role
