- [ ] Survey DroneCAN message specification/catalog
- [ ] Identify gaps - messages not yet implemented but potentially useful
- [ ] Prioritize the gap list with justification (e.g., use cases, user demand, strategic value)
- [ ] Estimate implementation effort for each priority message
- [ ] Document findings in project summary
