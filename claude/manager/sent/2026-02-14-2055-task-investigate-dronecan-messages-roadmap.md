# Task Assignment: Investigate DroneCAN Messages Roadmap

**Date:** 2026-02-14 20:55 | **From:** Manager | **To:** Developer | **Priority:** MEDIUM

## Task
Survey the DroneCAN message catalog and produce a prioritized roadmap of additional messages INAV should support, with justifications and effort estimates.

## Background
INAV currently supports a subset of DroneCAN messages (GPS, Battery, Node Status, etc.). This investigation should identify which additional DroneCAN messages would benefit INAV users and prioritize their implementation.

## Deliverables
1. Survey of available DroneCAN message types (from dronecan/DSDL)
2. Prioritized list of messages to implement (with justification)
3. Effort estimates for each priority message
4. Recommendations for future DroneCAN development

## Project Context
- **Project:** investigate-dronecan-messages-roadmap
- **Base Branch:** maintenance-9.x
- **Related Work:** Builds on recent DroneCAN driver improvements and DSDL integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Survey DroneCAN message specification documentation
- [ ] Identify messages already implemented in INAV
- [ ] List candidate messages for future implementation
- [ ] Prioritize based on: user demand, implementation complexity, feature completeness
- [ ] Provide effort estimates (Small: <1 day, Medium: 1-3 days, Large: >3 days)
- [ ] Document findings in project summary
